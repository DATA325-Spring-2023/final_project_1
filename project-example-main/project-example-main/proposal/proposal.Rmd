## 1. Introduction

Team Red aims to investigate USA Housing data to examine how various traits of houses might of changed throughout the progression of time. Additionally, it aims to compare certain variables of the dataset to understand how they may interact with each other. (For example, comparing house size to yard or garage size).

## 2. Data

The data provided originates from Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpandi007/usa-housing-dataset). The data is split into two csv files, with House_Train being the first half of the dataset and the only .csv to contain salesprices. For this reason, we can only use half the data to obtain limited insights of housing prices. Regardless of that fact, we can combine the two .csv files to obtain the fuller dataset which we will use for our analysis.


## 3. Data analysis plan

We plan to analyze the data for patterns. One of the first patterns we will look at is how housing sales prices had changed over the course of time or how housing sizes might have changed. We will also be selecting different variables and attempting to find a relationship between them such as how housing size may influence the number of chimneys or how they could be related. We don't expect to find causal relations, but hope to find new insights from the patterns we will discover by observing various relations.
